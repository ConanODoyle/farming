1) change lots/player system to auto save and clear after being offline for an hour - solves both limited lots issue + brickcount issues
1a) farming lot size will have a fixed max, so instead of "bigger farm" it'll be "choice of plants/farm design"
2) lots cost a *lot* of money and income is generally largely reduced across the board. however, you can go into debt to purchase the next lot upgrade, but must pay off that debt before you can purchase any lot or home upgrade. debt increases by 1% simple interest per day/week/whatever something like that so it gives people pressure to work to pay off but not a huge amount of pressure either.
2a) "home teledoor" so people can have a home without sacrificing lot space - ac sort of interior-only space they can choose to build
2b) tools wear out, cost money
3) fishing or mining for dead broke people who cant even afford seeds to grow stuff
3a) fishing/exploration for special bricks for building


- lots
	- by-blid save/loading, using an edited copy of autosaver
		- bricks placed on users lot or in users home will take ownership of that user (so saving is properly handled)
		- disable /clearbricks, inform player of /hardreset
	- keep queue of who was last online, pop queue and save + clear their bricks on dc
	- ensure at least 2-5 lot spots are free at any one time - gives time for autosaver to save and load, player choice
	- home teledoor
		- enclosed, roofed space. allows floating bricks via invisible modter. does not allow duplicator.
		- can build anything in here, including storage and crops. crops wont grow due to no sunlight.
		- only one home teledoor at any one time in either lot or home build
- tools rework
	- tools are now stackable >> have durability
		- disable or fully remove tools on 0 durability
	- repair event that repairs currently equipped tool (bot shopkeeper)
	- multiple models to represent durability level?
- quests
	- quest acquiring mechanics
		- visit a quest-giver's location, grab a quest note from their quest pad
			- if player already has active quest, send active quest back to their board
				- offer choice of swapping with active quest?
				- allow preference of default (swap or send to board)?
			- quest pad has event so players can use the pad/notes in their own builds without breaking things
		- can only pick up a quest every [interval] from a given quest-giver, per-player timeout
			- unique timeout per quest-giver?
			- every [interval], generate a new quest for each player
		- postings have event that pops up dialog box - ok = confirm quest
			- quests thus have to be encoded in string format for austosaver to properly handle quest posting saving
			- line 1: required items, line 2: reward items - items are fields, each field is a word pair of item/stack type and quantity
			- alternately, if lines end up not working out:
				- field 1: required items, field 2: reward items - items and counts are word pairs, every even word is item, every odd word is count
	- maximum quests at one time - four
		- posted on a player's quest board, can only hold three quests
			- if player drops quest while board is full, board can hold 4
		- player can only hold one on their person, click on a quest from the board to change active quest
			- if no active quest, quest is removed from the board
			- active quest is persistent - if player dies or disconnects, active quest is kept
		- total 4 quests - one on player, three on board
		- player can drop quest note to remove active quest
	- discarding quests
		- throw quest note into garbage bin
	- completing quest
		- deposit active quest's items at post office
		- when all requested items are deposited then deposit quest note itself and get reward
	- checking on quest progress
		- single quest note in inventory, displays info about current quest and completion when held
- fishing
	- on fishing rod use: throw unpickupable bobber item, which has density set so it floats on water
	- on fish ready to catch, play bob animation on bobber - aka minecraft mechanics copy
	- can display circle shadow on bobber based on catch type, so people can choose to wait for next bob to reel in
		- higher tier rods show more information on what is hooked?
	- fish sold at fish market, no other use for fish. also stackable.
