[b]-What is this?-[/b]
Build, explore, and farm on this expansive map to earn money and grow your business! Even if you don't 
want to farm, there's plenty to see and explore, and other ways you can make money to buy vehicles and items. 
Building is completely free, as well as your first plot of land, so freebuilds are allowed and encouraged!

[b]-How do I farm?-[/b]
Farming is very simple - buy dirt, buy seeds, plant the crops, and water them! No need for tilling or weeding, 
and crops don't die from dehydration! And no /slash commands to mess with either - everything is an item!

As you expand, you can purchase new items, vehicles, bricks, and crops to increase your income and make it 
easier to sell and buy large quantities of stuff at the market. Refer to the ingame tutorial for more information.
